# Advanced Programming – Mechanical Engineering (UFPE) – 2023.2

This repository contains the exercises, projects, and assignments developed for the **Advanced Programming** course in the **Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering** program at the **Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)** during the **2023.2** academic semester.

The course focuses on advanced programming concepts using **C++**, including object-oriented programming, pointers, fundamental algorithms, data structures, and build automation with Makefiles.

## Course Topics

Throughout the semester, students worked on the following core topics:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++  
  - Classes and Objects  
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism  
- Pointers and dynamic memory management  
  - Pointer arithmetic  
  - Pointers to functions and objects  
  - Memory allocation with `new` and `delete`  
- Searching algorithms:  
  - Linear Search  
  - Binary Search  
  - Interpolation Search  
  - Exponential Search  
- Sorting algorithms:  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
- Data Structures:  
  - Arrays  
  - Stacks  
  - Queues  
  - Binary Trees  
- Modular programming and code organization  
- File input/output with C++  
- Build automation with Makefiles  
- Good programming practices and documentation
